        <p class="indexMiddleItem2" class="fontColor"> The Frontier War is over. After decades of conflict between the IMC and the militia founded to 
        fight them, the region of space known as the Frontier can finally see peace.But liberation can
        come at a cost: the Frontier worlds were left barren by the war, and promised aid dwindled to 
        nothing. With no way to support themselves, those who remained had no choice but to leave their 
        homes. The brave relocated to the Outlands. A remote cluster of planets on the fringes of the
        Frontier, the Outlands are untouched by war and teeming with resources and opportunity. But life 
        is cheap here, and danger lurks around every corner. Its pioneers, explorers, and outlaws used to 
        spend their lives locked in an endless power struggle â€“ now, they settle their differences in the
        Apex Games, a bloodsport where Legends from all corners of the Frontier compete for money, fame, 
        and glory.</p>
